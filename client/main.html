<template name="about">
  <p><strong>About Blackpen</strong></p>
  <p>Blackpen began as a way to promote visual art appreciation among casual art critics with or without professional training, called blackpen critics. It invites anyone to submit writings about any artworks to be recorded and published on this website.</p>

  <p>Blackpen's approach is rarely a study of the artist's biography or the social contexts in which the artworks were made. Rather, Blackpen encourages art appreciation from the viewer's perspective, how the art form interacts with the viewer's personal context at the moment.</p> 

  <p>Blackpen is named after a 15-century Persian painter of the same name (<em>siyah qalam</em>), whose whimsical cartoon-like figures inspired the blackpen project.</p>

  <p>The Blackpen logo uses <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/uploads/files/siahqalam/siahqalam_fig_4.jpg" target="_blank">the techniques of gradient layers or folds that the 15-century artist used in his works.</a></p>

  <p>Blackpen is founded and operated by Minyong Cho, and you can hear more about her below.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Become a Blackpen Critic</strong></p>
    <p>You are invited to submit any writing on an artwork you find meaningful. Blackpen does not encourage you to conduct research to find the historical meanings of artworks. Rather, we want your personal story of why you find a particular artwork meaningful in your own settings, thereby contextualizing it within your own life experiences. Blackpen celebrates visual art’s enrichment of our everyday life.</p>

    <p>When submitting your writing, please include one picture that you have taken yourself of the artwork, so as not to infringe upon any other photographer’s copyright. You will be notified by email within a week if your submission is accepted, and, if accepted, you will be asked if you would like to read out loud your writing and record it yourself or would like one of us to do it on your behalf to be published on blackpen.org.</p>

    <p>You can also submit your comments or reactions to the recordings on blackpen.org. We will review your comments and publish them next to the recordings.</p>

    <p>Please email your submission to <a href="mailto:info@blackpen.org">info@blackpen.org</a></p>
