<template name="about">
  <p><strong>About Blackpen</strong></p>
  <p>Blackpen began as a way to promote visual art appreciation among casual art critics with or without professional training, called blackpen critics. It invites anyone to submit writings about any artworks to be recorded and published on this website.</p>

  <p>Blackpen's approach is rarely a study of the artist's biography or the social contexts in which the artworks were made. Rather, Blackpen encourages art appreciation from the viewer's perspective, how the art form interacts with the viewer's personal context at the moment.</p> 

  <p>Blackpen is named after a 15-century Persian painter of the same name (<em>siyah qalam</em>), whose whimsical cartoon-like figures inspired the blackpen project.</p>

  <p>The Blackpen logo uses <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/uploads/files/siahqalam/siahqalam_fig_4.jpg" target="_blank">the techniques of gradient layers or folds that the 15-century artist used in his works.</a></p>

  <p>Blackpen is founded and operated by Minyong Cho, and you can hear more about her below.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Become a Blackpen Critic</strong></p>
    <p>You are invited to submit any writing on an artwork you find meaningful to you. Black pen is not seeking art historical studies that delve into the artists’ biographies or manifestoes, although if you do submit such studies, they might be published without having it evaluated by your peer scholars. In that sense, Blackpen does not require you to situate the artworks in their contemporary contextual settings and does not encourage you to conduct research to learn the historical meanings of the artworks. Rather, we want your personal story of why you find an artwork meaningful in your own settings, thereby contextualizing it within your own life experiences. Blackpen celebrates visual art’s place in our everyday life and its enrichment of our life experiences.</p>

    <p>When submitting your writing, please include one picture that you have taken yourself of the artwork, so as not to infringe upon any other photographers’ copywrights. You will be notified by email within a week if the submission is accepted, and, if accepted, you will be asked if you would like to record your writing yourself or would like one of us to read it out loud for the final recording to be published on blackpen.org.</p>

    <p>Please email your submission to <a href="mailto:info@blackpen.org">info@blackpen.org</a></p>

<template name="about-me">
    <p>About me</p>

    <p>Looking back as a middle-aged woman, I am proud of one accomplishment in my life -- I failed excellently.</p>

    <p>I mean I reached far and leaped high from a low-class immigrant family with an unemployed alcoholic father who physically and verbally abused me all my childhood to the end of his being jailed for it and a mother who described to me her efforts to abort me because I was conceived out of wedlock and her resolution to continually blame me for his abuse. This might be a lot for some people to swallow in one sentence, but for me this was the only family I knew when I ran off to MIT to practically begin to learn to live without their abuse, which I liken to drug withdrawal.</p>

    <p>Then I fell down. With a Bachelor's degree from MIT, I failed to get a high-paying job as my sister did from graduating from UC Berkeley. I guess that’s what you are supposed to do coming from a poor family, but I was much more interested in studying art that I just saw on the trip around the world. Going to the University of Michigan for my PhD, however, signaled another way to a bright future. My getting married also promised a productive life -- a family I will build with my husband and a house we will buy and furnish, with cars in the garage. My family, waking up to the fact that I was not a useless punch bag after all, saw the potential return on investment and relaxed a bit into forging a workable relationship with some communication back and forth.</p>

    <p>So when I filed for a divorce, I was a successful academic, a wife, a daughter, a sister with more social ties than I’d ever had in my life. Nobody understood why I was leaving a happy marriage, but I I knew I had to put an end to all the successes in my life. From graduate school, I’ve gained art historical tools to examine my personal history more systemically, and I realized that a mere pretense of happiness was not good enough for me. After divorce, I slowly stripped myself of all my roles, to finally leaving Academia shortly after finishing a postdoc at Harvard.</p> 

    <p>That was six years ago.</p>

    <p>Since then, I've carved out a place for myself in the world with my bare hands, and in the process I can confidently say I’ve found something I always wanted but never knew what it was because I didn’t have it.</p>

    <p>That is, I’m free.</p>

    <p>I know firsthand you have to fail to be free. Maybe I don't fully understand the sweetness of success or comfort of social ties, but I could never be myself without the cool assurance of freedom that runs through my spine and that impels me to skinny-dip alone in an oasis that is in everyone else's mirage.</p>

    <p>Now I’m free to experiment. I can even talk about art without having anyone to listen.</p>
